To be able to run the code you can "Run all" and you will get a resulst,
Before that make sure you have all the relevant and updated libraries as mention in the requirements.txt file, else it might not work
Also please make sure to change the paths:

"Path/To/Data" - replace with the real path of the dataset
"Path/To/Model" - replace with the real path of the Model (model.h5)
Path/To/Photo - replace with the real path of the banknote that you want to check


Note: if vs.distribution() and vs.scatter() you can ignore them since they are only to illustrate some of the data but they are not necessary for the model
